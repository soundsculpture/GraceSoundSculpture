# GraceSoundSculpture
This repository contains the program and sound files necessary to repair an Edward Weiss sound sculpture.
The program you need is called "change name later .py", and the sound files are all located in the "Wav2.zip" folder.
For the program to work correctly, make sure to put the sound files in the "downloads" file location on your Raspberry Pi.
It does not matter where you put the program on your Raspberry Pi.
